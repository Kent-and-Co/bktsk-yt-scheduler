== Frequently asked questions ==

### What can be done with this plugin?

You can make YouTube Live schedule as each posts.  Of course, this information will be automatically used for making iCalendar file.
The iCalendar file would be delivered using specified url (you can change the slug for that on the setting page), so everyone can subscribe it to major calendar apps or services.

### Is this able to show the calendar?

I'm sorry this function is now in progress.  Please wait for that!
Instead of this feature, you can use iframe of Google Calendar.  Add your iCalendar with the URL and get the code of iframe on the setting page of the Google Calendar.  Now you can put the calendar on any other space!!

### Donation?
